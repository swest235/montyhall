Description: This package creates the game show "Let's Make a Deal" or more commonly known as the Monty Hall Game. The game consists of 2 goats, and 1 car each 
randomly assigned to 1 of 3 doors. The objective is for the contestant to pick the door containing a car. The game works by the contestant first picking a door, 
followed by the host picking a door that contains a goat (not the contestants initial pick - if it is a goat). The contestant then has one final opporuntity to choose
to stay with their initial pick, or switch to the other unopened door. The debate around the gameshow was whether the stay or switch strategy were best. This package 
allows the user to recreate game plays and simulate numerous games in order to analyze strategy outcomes.

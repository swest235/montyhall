Description: This package recreates the steps of the "Let's Make a Deal" game, or more commonly known, The Monty Hall Game. 
The game purpose is for the contestant to select among 3 doors, one containing a car, the other two containing goats. The doors
are first randomly arranged, followed by a guess from the contestant as to which door contains the car. Once the contestant 
selects a door, the host then reveals a door that contains a goat. After which, the contestant has one final opportunity to 
either stay and keep the door they originally selected, or switch, and choose the final remaining door. If the door they selected 
holds a car, they win, if anything else, they lose. The strategy of stay or switch has been heavily debated. This package also 
enables users to run 'n' number of simulations to check with strategy works best. Step-by-step this package will enable users
to go through each phase of the game and generate the results - even run hundreds or thousands of simulations.
